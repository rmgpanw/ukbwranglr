# Overview

The goal of `ukbwranglr` is to facilitate exploratory analyses with UK Biobank phenotype data. A raw UK Biobank phenotype file (or a subset of selected columns) can be loaded into R with human-readable labels:

*Raw data appearance:*

```{r include=FALSE}
raw_data <- data.table::fread(DUMMY_DATA_PATH)
raw_data <- raw_data %>% 
  select(eid, 
         `31-0.0`, 
         `34-0.0`,
         `21000-0.0`, 
         `20002-0.0`, 
         `21001-0.0`) %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
raw_data
```


*Appearance when loaded using `ukbwranglr::read_pheno()`:*

```{r include=FALSE}
data_dict <- ukbwranglr::pheno_data_dict(DUMMY_DATA_PATH, delim = ",")
ukbwranglr_data <- ukbwranglr::read_pheno(DUMMY_DATA_PATH, data_dict, delim = ",") 

ukbwranglr_data <- ukbwranglr_data %>% 
  select(eid, 
         sex_f31_0_0, 
         year_of_birth_f34_0_0, 
         ethnic_background_f21000_0_0,
         noncancer_illness_code_selfreported_f20002_0_0,
         body_mass_index_bmi_f21001_0_0) %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ukbwranglr_data
```

Also included are functions to help with pre-processing the data into an analysable format. For example:

- Identify participants with certain health conditions or taking certain medications (with dates)
- Summarise repeated biomarker measurements (e.g. extract the mean systolic blood pressure measurement)

Please see ['getting started'](https://rmgpanw.github.io/ukbwranglr/articles/ukbwranglr.html) on the [package documentation website](https://rmgpanw.github.io/ukbwranglr/index.html) for further details. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of ukbwranglr from [GitHub](https://github.com/rmgpanw/ukbwranglr/tree/dtable) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmgpanw/ukbwranglr")
```
## Basic usage - reading a UK Biobank dataset into R

Steps:

1. Create a data dictionary specific to your UK Biobank file - this is generated by downloading the full UK Biobank data dictionary, available on their website [here](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide)
1. Filter this for the variables you require (optional)
1. Read your selected columns into R

This process is outlined below for dummy data generated using the [tofu library](https://github.com/spiros/tofu). Details of how to do this using dummy UK Biobank data (included with this package) are [here](TODO).

### Create data dictionary

```{r eval=FALSE}
# load package
library(ukbwranglr)

# create data dictionary
data_dict <- pheno_data_dict("MY_UKB_FILE.tab")
```

### Filter data dictionary for required variables (optional)

>*Note: you could also write the data dictionary to a `.csv` file and filter for your required fields manually in excel*

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Filter for sex, year of birth, BMI and self-reported noncancer-illness fields
data_dict <- data_dict %>%
  dplyr::filter(FieldID %in% c(31,
                               34,
                               21001,
                               20002))
```

### Read selected columns into R

```{r eval=FALSE}
ukb_pheno <- read_pheno(path = "MY_UKB_FILE.tab", 
                        ukb_data_dict = data_dict)
```
