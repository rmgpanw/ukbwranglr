# Overview

The goal of `ukbwranglr` is to facilitate exploratory analyses with UK
Biobank phenotype data. A raw UK Biobank phenotype file (or a subset of
selected columns) can be loaded into R with human-readable labels:

*Raw data appearance:*

Also included are functions to help with pre-processing the data into an
analysable format. For example:

  - Identify participants with certain health conditions or taking
    certain medications (with dates)
  - Summarise repeated biomarker measurements (e.g. extract the mean
    systolic blood pressure measurement)

Please see [‘getting
started’](https://rmgpanw.github.io/ukbwranglr/articles/ukbwranglr.html)
on the [package documentation
website](https://rmgpanw.github.io/ukbwranglr/index.html) for further
details.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ukbwranglr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rmgpanw/ukbwranglr/tree/dtable) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmgpanw/ukbwranglr")
```

## Basic usage - reading a UK Biobank dataset into R

Steps:

1.  Create a data dictionary specific to your UK Biobank file - this is
    generated by downloading the full UK Biobank data dictionary,
    available on their
    [website](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide)
2.  Filter this for the variables you require (optional)
3.  Read your selected columns into R

This process is outlined below for dummy data generated using the [tofu
library](https://github.com/spiros/tofu). Details of how to do this
using dummy UK Biobank data (included with this package) are
[here](TODO).

### Create data dictionary

``` r
# load package
library(ukbwranglr)

# create data dictionary
data_dict <- pheno_data_dict("MY_UKB_FILE.tab")
```

### Filter data dictionary for required variables (optional)

> *Note: you could also write the data dictionary to a `.csv` file and
> filter for your required fields manually in excel*

``` r
# Filter for sex, year of birth, BMI and self-reported noncancer-illness fields
data_dict <- data_dict %>%
  dplyr::filter(FieldID %in% c(31,
                               34,
                               21001,
                               20002))
```

### Read selected columns into R

``` r
ukb_pheno <- read_pheno(path = "MY_UKB_FILE.tab", 
                        pheno_data_dict = data_dict)
```
