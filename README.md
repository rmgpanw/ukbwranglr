# Overview

The goal of `ukbwranglr` is to make getting started with UK Biobank
phenotype data easier. A raw UK Biobank phenotype file (or subset of)
can be loaded into R with human-readable labels without requiring any
additional dependencies. A basic usage example for this provided below.

Raw data appearance:

    #>      eid 31-0.0 34-0.0 21000-0.0 20002-0.0 21001-0.0
    #> 1: fake1      1     NA         2      1366   25.0105
    #> 2: fake2      1   1941      4001        NA   23.1302
    #> 3: fake3      1   1946      2001      1575   24.8198
    #> 4: fake4      0   1959      2002      1421   27.9837
    #> 5: fake5      0   1955        NA      1312   18.4092

Also included are functions to help with pre-processing the data into an
analysable format. Please see [‘getting started’]() on the [package
documentation website](https://rmgpanw.github.io/ukbwranglr/index.html)
for further details.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ukbwranglr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rmgpanw/ukbwranglr/tree/dtable) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmgpanw/ukbwranglr")
```

## Basic usage - reading a UK Biobank dataset into R

Steps:

1.  Create a data dictionary specific to your UK Biobank file - this is
    generated by downloading the full UK Biobank data dictionary,
    available on their website
    [here](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide)
2.  Filter this for the variables you require (optional)
3.  Read your selected columns into R

This process is outlined below for dummy data generated using the [tofu
library](https://github.com/spiros/tofu). Details of how to do this
using dummy UK Biobank data (included with this package) are
[here](TODO)

### Create data dictionary

``` r
# load package
library(ukbwranglr)

# create data dictionary
data_dict <- pheno_data_dict("PATH_TO_MY_UKB_FILE.tab")
```

### Filter for required variables (optional)

*Note: you could also write the data dictionary to a `.csv` file and
filter manually in excel*

``` r
# Filter for sex, year of birth, BMI and self-reported noncancer-illness fields
data_dict <- data_dict %>%
  dplyr::filter(FieldID %in% c(31,
                               34,
                               21001,
                               20002))
```

### Read selected columns into R

``` r
ukb_pheno <- read_pheno(path = "PATH_TO_MY_UKB_FILE.tab", 
                        ukb_data_dict = data_dict)
```

## TODO

  - Add globalvariables() to remove notes when runnning `check()` (see
    <https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/08/no-visible-binding-for-global-variable/>)
  - Redo `read_pheno()` to use data.table syntax
