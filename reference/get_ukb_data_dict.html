If the participant was uncertain of the type of cancer they had had, then they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to place it within the coding tree. If the cancer could not be located in the coding tree then the interviewer entered a free-text description of it. These free-text descriptions were subsequently examined by a doctor and, where possible, matched to entries in the coding tree.

If the participant was uncertain of the type of operation they had undergone, then they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to place it within the coding tree. If the operation could not be located in the coding tree then the interviewer entered a free-text description of it. These free-text descriptions were subsequently examined by a doctor and, where possible, matched to entries in the coding tree. Free-text descriptions which could not be matched with very high probability have been marked as ""unclassifiable"".</span>

For example if the year was given as 1970, then the value presented is 1970.5   If the participant gave their age then the value presented is the fractional year corresponding to the mid-point of that age. For example, if the participant said they were 30 years old then the value is the date at which they were 30years+6months.

Please note that we have opted to populate this data-field with the episode start date (EPISTART in the HESIN table) or, if that was missing, the admission start date (ADMIDATE in the HESIN table) rather than use the operation date (OPDATE in the HESIN_OPER table). The rationale for this was:    around 1 in 5 primary procedures lacked a corresponding value for OPDATE in HESIN_OPER;     some recorded OPDATEs were inconsistent with the other date fields such as EPISTART, ADMIDATE, EPIEND and DISDATE (most likely due to data entry errors);     for those episodes with a value for OPDATE recorded the majority were the same as the value of EPISTART, with around 99% of OPDATE values within 7 days of the value of EPISTART;     values of EPISTART/ADMIDATE are more complete and thus may provide greater consistency across data providers.
